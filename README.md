# MAGIC_Gamma_Telescope
Using the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset to apply different classification models such as Logistic Regression and KNearest Neighbor (K-NN). Also to tune the parameters of these models and compare the performance of models with each other.

This repository contains a report, an IPython Notebook, and a dataset for [insert purpose or topic of the project].

## Files

The repository consists of the following files:

1. [report.pdf](report.pdf): This file is the report including the models classification report, best params, accuracies of each param and confusion matrix.

2. [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb): This file is an IPython Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations related to the project. It is an interactive document that can be executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The notebook provides step-by-step explanations and showcases the project's implementation details.

3. [dataset.csv](dataset.csv): This file is the dataset used in the IPython Notebook. It contains the raw or processed data that was used for the analysis and experiments. The dataset plays a crucial role in reproducing the results and understanding the context of the project.
